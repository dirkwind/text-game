# Text Game
This is a work-in-progress text-based game I am making. Although there is no story yet, the game should work if you download the dependencies listed below.
## Dependencies
You will need:
  1. simpleaudio (`pip install simpleaudio`)
  2. playsound (`pip install playsound`)
  3. progbar (`pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ progbar`)\
  
The last one is my own custom module.
